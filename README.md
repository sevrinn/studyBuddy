Group Project Proposal:
<studyBuddy />
studyBuddy is a study timer and music player to stream your favorite focus music in the background while doing homework or a project. 

Features:
- Sign into app (with spotify API authenticate)
Main Timer
- set minutes for study / break time / (number of cycles to repeat )
- pressling start/pause button starts/pauses timer (and the music?)
- when study time is complete, sound a chime, 
- start break time (with an on screen message maybe?)

Music Player
- pull data from api ( i was thinking a few pre-generated public playlists, or maybe pull up the signed in users playlists if they have any)
- boogie to the music

based loosely on the Pomodoro study technique
